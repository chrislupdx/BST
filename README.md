# C++ Project 4:  Binary Search Tree

### What
This is a binary search tree that manages a list of songs we store on a file (music.txt).

### Challenges
Binary search tree algorithmns for retrieval, deletion, insertion, and removal requires
an understanding of how to traverse binary search trees, there were a lot of cases for some of these functions!

### Parts I Enjoyed
Once I got insert and delete written, I had a huge amount of fun seeing what changes (like what we index,
table size, making certain values prime) the collision effect on the table.

### Conflict 
This was maybe one of the toughest data structures I ever wrote!

### Stuff I wish I did
